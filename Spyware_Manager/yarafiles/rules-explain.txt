rule master is a free to use open source rulesets for yara.
ive been using those rules in my project as it lets me detect a large
amount of malware and malicious files using it.

the pe rules are also from the same source however focus on packers so i
decided not to put them in the same folder as the rules that focus more on
spywares.
